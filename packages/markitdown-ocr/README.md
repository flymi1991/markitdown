# MarkItDown OCR Plugin

LLM Vision plugin for MarkItDown that extracts text from images embedded in PDF, DOCX, PPTX, and XLSX files.

Uses OpenAI-compatible OCR settings from `markitdown_config.json` - no new ML libraries or binary dependencies required.

## Features

- **Enhanced PDF Converter**: Extracts text from images within PDFs, with full-page OCR fallback for scanned documents
- **Enhanced DOCX Converter**: OCR for images in Word documents
- **Enhanced PPTX Converter**: OCR for images in PowerPoint presentations
- **Enhanced XLSX Converter**: OCR for images in Excel spreadsheets
- **Context Preservation**: Maintains document structure and flow when inserting extracted text

## Installation

```bash
pip install markitdown-ocr
```

The plugin uses whatever OpenAI-compatible client you already have. Install one if you don't have it yet:

```bash
pip install openai
```

## Usage

### Command Line

```bash
markitdown document.pdf --use-plugins
```

### Python API

Enable plugins. The OCR model is loaded from the `ocr_llm` section in `markitdown_config.json`:

```python
from markitdown import MarkItDown

md = MarkItDown(
    enable_plugins=True,
)

result = md.convert("document_with_images.pdf")
print(result.text_content)
```

If `ocr_llm` is not configured, the plugin still loads, but OCR is silently skipped - falling back to the standard built-in converter.

### Configuration

Place `markitdown_config.json` next to `markitdown.exe` or in the active Python environment's `Scripts` directory:

```json
{
  "ocr_llm": {
    "api_key": "YOUR_API_KEY",
    "base_url": "https://your-openai-compatible-endpoint.example",
    "model": "your-vision-model"
  }
}
```

Do not commit real API keys.

### Custom Prompt

Override the default extraction prompt for specialized documents:

```python
md = MarkItDown(
    enable_plugins=True,
    llm_prompt="Extract all text from this image, preserving table structure.",
)
```

## How It Works

When `MarkItDown(enable_plugins=True)` is called:

1. MarkItDown discovers the plugin via the `markitdown.plugin` entry point group
2. It calls `register_converters()`
3. The plugin creates an `LLMVisionOCRService` from `markitdown_config.json` `ocr_llm`
4. Four OCR-enhanced converters are registered at **priority -1.0** — before the built-in converters at priority 0.0

When a file is converted:

1. The OCR converter accepts the file
2. It extracts embedded images from the document
3. Each image is sent to the LLM with an extraction prompt
4. The returned text is inserted inline, preserving document structure
5. If the LLM call fails, conversion continues without that image's text

## Supported File Formats

### PDF

- Embedded images are extracted by position (via `page.images` / page XObjects) and OCR'd inline, interleaved with the surrounding text in vertical reading order.
- **Scanned PDFs** (pages with no extractable text) are detected automatically: each page is rendered at 300 DPI and sent to the LLM as a full-page image.
- **Malformed PDFs** that pdfplumber/pdfminer cannot open (e.g. truncated EOF) are retried with PyMuPDF page rendering, so content is still recovered.

### DOCX

- Images are extracted via document part relationships (`doc.part.rels`).
- OCR is run before the DOCX→HTML→Markdown pipeline executes: placeholder tokens are injected into the HTML so that the markdown converter does not escape the OCR markers, and the final placeholders are replaced with the formatted `*[Image OCR]...[End OCR]*` blocks after conversion.
- Document flow (headings, paragraphs, tables) is fully preserved around the OCR blocks.

### PPTX

- Picture shapes, placeholder shapes with images, and images inside groups are all supported.
- Shapes are processed in top-to-left reading order per slide.
- If `ocr_llm` is configured, the OCR vision model extracts text from slide images.

### XLSX

- Images embedded in worksheets (`sheet._images`) are extracted per sheet.
- Cell position is calculated from the image anchor coordinates (column/row → Excel letter notation).
- Images are listed under a `### Images in this sheet:` section after the sheet's data table — they are not interleaved into the table rows.

### Output format

Every extracted OCR block is wrapped as:

```text
*[Image OCR]
<extracted text>
[End OCR]*
```

## Troubleshooting

### OCR text missing from output

The most likely cause is a missing `ocr_llm` config or a missing OpenAI-compatible client package. Verify `markitdown_config.json`:

```json
{
  "ocr_llm": {
    "api_key": "YOUR_API_KEY",
    "base_url": "https://your-openai-compatible-endpoint.example",
    "model": "your-vision-model"
  }
}
```

Also verify that `openai` is installed and `markitdown --use-plugins` is used.

### Plugin not loading

Confirm the plugin is installed and discovered:

```bash
markitdown --list-plugins   # should show: ocr
```

### API errors

The plugin propagates LLM API errors as warnings and continues conversion. Check your API key, quota, and that the chosen model supports vision inputs.
